With this tool, you can easily check whether your servers are online and keep track of their status.

## Exercise "Server OK?"

## Features

- Perform ping checks for servers based on their IP address or hostname
- Add, delete, or list servers through an interactive terminal interface
- Operate the system via command-line interface using `sys.argv`
- Keep track of data and checks performed in a JSON file
- Two modes available: management mode and check mode
- Generate an HTML page that reports on the state of the servers using a template file 
- Organized code with multiple modules and functions
